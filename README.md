Outlier detection is useful for preprocessing tasks for analysis or machine learning. Or as an analytical method of its own merit. 
There are three main types of outliers.  
1> point outlier :   observations that are anomalous with respect to the majority of observations in the feature
2> contextual outlier : observations that are considered anomalous given a specific context
3> collective outliers. Collection of observation anomalous  but appear close to one another bcoz they all have similar anamalous value
